This folder contains the most useful notebooks to train/eval/run the semi-supervised model.
* `quick_training` is functionally the same as `detailed training`, but without the complex documentation and methods defined in the notebook. It pulls the methods from the architecture folder, which has scripts of predefined functions.
* `interpret` allows for model evaluation, through a variety of metrics, saliency scores of words in test strings, and encoding generation tools. 
* `inference` runs the given models on any given data, outputting a folder of cohort files, with relevant model predictions.
